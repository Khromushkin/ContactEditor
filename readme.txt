Contact Editor - AddressBook Native Extension
author: memeller@gmail.com

Currently supported:
getContactCount - gets the number of contacts in AddressBook
getContacts - gets contacts from AddressBook (name, lastname, compositename, phones, emails, recordid, birthdate)
Experimental:
addcontact - adds contact to AddressBook (memory management may need fixing)

Not much, but still better than accesing the sql database directly ;)
Tested on iPad, iOS 5.01
