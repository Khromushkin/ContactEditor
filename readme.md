### Info about rotation issues on iOS ###
On iPad system dialogs sometimes have problems with rotation (for example if the application is using landscape orientation, the window is shown in portrait / after pressing 'done' the view is dismissed, but the application is rotated (portrait instead of landscape / landscape instead of portrait). It appears to be a bug in Adobe AIR, since in simulator it runs well. It is fixed in AIR 3.3 (currently available from labs.adobe.com), so just compile your app using 3.3 and everything should work well.


Mateusz added implementation for Android platform and cleaned up some mess i left in files, so big thanks to him for his work! :)

As always android requires manifests. Just for accessing contacts informations:

    < uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS" />
  
But more if Your app is going to add or remove any info:

    < uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS" />
    #only if adding:
    < uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS" />
    
To pick a contact it is necessary to ad also : 
			
			<application>
				<activity android:name="pl.mateuszmackowiak.nativeANE.contactManager.PickContactHandler" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"></activity>
			</application>
			
### ANE compilation ###
To compile the ane, osx widh iOS SDK is needed. This ane uses AddressBook framework, which has to be linked during the compilation (sample ane build.sh is provided in build directory, it already includes the link to AddressBook framework).

Tested on iPad, iOS 5.01 / Andorid 3.1,4.03
(on ICS a system dialog pops up asking for permission to access AddressBook, which is a standard system action)
