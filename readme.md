* (new, iOS only) getContactBitmapData - returns bitmap data of image used as contact photo
* (new, iOS only) addContactInWindow - shows native window for adding new contact
* (new, iOS only) showContactDetailsInWindow - shows native window for viewing contact details. If 'isEditable' parameter is set to true, enables editing of contact details.
* pickContact - shows system contact picker, that enables user to select desired contact from list. After selecting the picker is dismissed, and the selected recordId is sent using ContactEditorEvent.CONTACT_SELECTED 
* getContactCount - gets the number of contacts in AddressBook
* getContacts - gets contacts from AddressBook (name, lastname, compositename, phones, emails, recordid, birthdate, (NEW) addresses)
* addcontact - adds contact to AddressBook
* removeContact - removes contact with specified recordId
* isSupported - returns if ane is supported on current platform, added on request from Mateusz  
added after feedback from Mateusz(https://github.com/mateuszmackowiak)
* getContactsSimple - gets contacts from AddressBook(compositename, recordid), shoud be faster than getContacts, because it requires less processing.
* getContactDetails - gets details for specified contact

### Info about rotation issues on iOS ###
On iPad system dialogs sometimes have problems with rotation (for example if the application is using landscape orientation, the window is shown in portrait / after pressing 'done' the view is dismissed, but the application is rotated (portrait instead of landscape / landscape instead of portrait). It appears to be a bug in Adobe AIR, since in simulator it runs well. It is fixed in AIR 3.3 (currently available from labs.adobe.com), so just compile your app using 3.3 and everything should work well.


Mateusz added implementation for Android platform and cleaned up some mess i left in files, so big thanks to him for his work! :)

As always android requires manifests. Just for accessing contacts informations:

    < uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CONTACTS" />
  
But more if Your app is going to add or remove any info:

    < uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS" />
    #only if adding:
    < uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS" />
    
To pick a contact it is necessary to ad also : 
			
			<application>
				<activity android:name="pl.mateuszmackowiak.nativeANE.contactManager.PickContactHandler" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"></activity>
			</application>
			
### ANE compilation ###
To compile the ane, osx widh iOS SDK is needed. This ane uses AddressBook framework, which has to be linked during the compilation (sample ane build.sh is provided in build directory, it already includes the link to AddressBook framework).

Tested on iPad, iOS 5.01 / Andorid 3.1,4.03
(on ICS a system dialog pops up asking for permission to access AddressBook, which is a standard system action)

### iOS 6 support ###
AddressBook access was changed in iOS 6, unfortunatelly with no backwards compatibility. I've added the updated code under ios6 branch, i've only had a chance to test it under ios simulator, everything worked well. To compile, AIR 3.5 is needed (or earlier version with ios6 sdk linked using platformsdk switch or flash builder 4.7). The compilation works (if you get any errors connected with 'Undefined symbols for architecture armv7:' you have not included ios6 sdk or are not using AIR 3.5), and the ane should also work without problems. Since iOS 6 also brought some changes to presentModalViewController and dismissModalViewControllerAnimated these function calls were also updated. This branch removes the old 'getContacts' method, which is no longer supported (use getContactsSimple + getContactDetails), due to changes in permissions a new function (hasPermission) has been introduced to determine the status of permissions to use address book. Again - ios6 branch is experimental, it has not been yet fully tested on real devices running iOS 6 (Apple, why u not bring iOS 6 to older devices?), so it should not be used in production environment.
